						<p align="justify">My name is Nataly. I graduated from university with a master’s degree in IT, but I worked as an accountant for 3 years. I like sport, reading books and watching movies with an unpredictable end. I like when everything is accurately and correctly, I am perfectionist. That’s why I want to change job and work as a QA. In my opinion QA engineers do very important work: they make product better every day.
